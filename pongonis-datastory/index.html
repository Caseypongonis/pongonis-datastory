      <p><h3>Data Viz Project</h3>
        Before we touched technology and started projects which analyzed data in this class, we thought about how we are participants in algorithmic audiences in our everyday lives. This first project involved us as students to think creatively of ways in which we are data in our everyday lives, and ways in which the things we interact with are data as well. This philosophical appraoch made the concept "data" much more personal, sharable and meaningful which allowed us to understand it intimately and work with data to create an arching narrative over the semester.  
         </p>
      <p> For my Data-Story Project, I was interested in the amount of emails I received on a daily basis and wanted to explore not just the quantity, but the quality of those emails too. For five days, I recorded on a spreadsheet how many emails I received, what the email's motive was, and then rated how important the email was to me within a certain category: money, academia, travel, personal, and career. After collecting this data, I created a categorical graph in Inkscape of five flowers-one to represent each day- to show the meaning and importance of the emails I got. I used flowers because the messages I received often grew and blossomed into something much more to my life than the technical words in an electronic message. I used different colors on the flower petals to represent the 5 categories of relevance, different petal shape to show the emotions I felt after receiving the message, varying petal size to show how important or how little the message meant to me, and lastly I used two different color thorns on the stem of the flower to represent the motive behind the message. It was so satisfying to see the data I collected in a creative and simple visual representation which has so much more of a story behind the cute images you see.

        <h3>The Great Take-Away</h3>
          <p> This project taught me how to come up with a question which could be measured and one which I could reap plottable data from. This means we as students had to learn and think about a question's answers in terms of X and Y. Luckily, Professor Lindgren takes a philosophical approach at first when thinking about data and technology so this kind of abstract thinking was easy, creative, and flexible to many outcomes. </p>
        <p> My favorite part of this project besides creating the visual representation, was actually recording the raw, hard data everywhere we went. I had a notebook which I logged my emails in and created an excel spreadsheet for my data so I could easily draw conclusions. </p>
        <p>Recording the data and making it clean was just the beginning. Once it was up on a spreadsheet we were to start making connections and creating any possible narratives the data was trying to tell us. This section was taking observations and making them something meaningful, sharable, and relevant to ourselves and other people.</p>
        <p>Creating our Scalable Vector Graphic on Inkscape was a first for most everybody in the class. This part of the project was frustrating and helpful. I got to learn a new program, a new term (SVG) and learn by doing. The trial and error process is tedious of course, but was a great foundation for us as students who would be learning the language of coding in a few short months. This project rapidly transformed my understanding of data, the power it has to tell a true and compelling story, and showed me how to translate that valuable information to a wider audience. </p>

       <h2>Connecting It to Bigger Social Issues</h2>
       <p>Once we watched our simple curiousity come to fruition in our visual representation, it was time to apply that idea towards something bigger. Now we were thinking about broader social issues which are connected to our mundane, everday digital practices. We had the opportunity to delve into further research on one of the following current concepts relating to digital technology: Algorithmic Audiences, Data Brokering, Psychographics, Public/Private, and User Rights. </p>
       <p>Once we decided on what topic struck our interest the strongest, we were off to the books and internet to explore articles and scholaraly texts which contained research on the concept. I decided to explore Algorithmic Audiences because during the same semester for this course I was in a Professional Writing Class where we emphasized how importance audience awareness is in order to have successful and meaningful content. After gathering important information about Algorithmic Audiences like its definition, how it is used, how transparent it is and more, I created an outline for a script I would use to speak from when I was filming my Explained-Video. </p>
       <p> This project, much like the others, allowed a lot of personal freedom and creativity. We could use screen filming on our devices, motion graphics, slideshows, live casts, but me being an old-school kind of girl I decided to work on my speaking skills and film myself speaking for the video. This made me aware and conscious of both what I was talking about but also how I was talking about the subject. I had to keep my favorite podcasters and speakers in mind and use engaging body language, eye contact, and tone of voice in a way that didn't bore whoever was watching my video. This project enlightened me on the personal and technical skills it takes to be successful in the popular, diverse of video media. </p>

     <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
      <p>This Writing & Digital Media Class has probably been the most beneficial college course I have completed here at Virginia Tech University because it has equipped me with so many diverse, practical, and desirable skills. By initiating the course with our own, individual research question of our choice allows the opportunity for us as students to continuously think of and apply the class concepts in our lives and keep the wheels in our mind turning. This course also helped knock down any walls of fear towards learning and using new softwares or programs. Most of us were new to Inkscape and navigated our way through its many features to create something that represented a story we were trying to tell. The Video Project taught us the basic fundamentals to the video creation process from the research, to scripting, then filming, and finally the video editing and publishing details. </p>
     <p> The last section of the course is where I believe the most complex, yet desirable skills lie. In this advanced, technology driven time, it is so comforting to have a basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS, and understand CSS Grid. This class not only gives English Majors at Virginia Tech an advantage over English Majors at other universities, but it also creates a community with increased awareness of personal and widespread digital practices from both perspective of the user and the creator. </p>
